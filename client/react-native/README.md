### Requirements

Node 8 or greater is required. Development for iOS requires a Mac and Xcode 9 or up, and will target iOS 9 and up.

- `npm install` to install the dependencies
- `npx jetify`
- `npm run link` to link assets
- run the following steps for your platform

#### Android

- `cd ios`
- `pod install` to install pod dependencies
- `cd ..` to come back to the root folder
